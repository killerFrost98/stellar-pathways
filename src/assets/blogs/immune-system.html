      <h2>The Genesis – Cell Reproduction</h2>
      <article id="cell-replication">
        <p>Every living being is made of cells, and their replication is at the heart of life. Cell division creates new cells
          to allow growth, repair, and reproduction. Human cells carefully duplicate themselves via mitosis—a process that
          is slower and more deliberate compared to the rapid reproduction seen in many microorganisms. In contrast, viruses
          are not considered living cells because they require a host to replicate. They attach to host cells and hijack
          their cellular machinery to produce new viral particles, often leading to infection and disease. Bacteria, on the
          other hand, are living organisms that duplicate by binary fission, a process where a single bacterial cell divides
          into two identical daughter cells, enabling rapid multiplication under favorable conditions.</p>
        <div class="note">
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Human cells replicate via mitosis with robust error-checking, keeping mutations low, whereas many
            RNA viruses replicate quickly and less accurately. However over time, these repair mechanisms may decline, allowing
            DNA damage to accumulate and increasing cancer risk in older individuals.

      <article id="immune-system">
        <p>Your immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that protect you from pathogens. It operates
          on two major levels:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The Innate Immune System:</strong> This is your first line of defense, featuring physical barriers like skin
            and rapid-response cells such as macrophages and neutrophils.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Adaptive Immune System:</strong> This system specializes in identifying specific invaders. B cells and T
            cells, with their unique receptors, tailor responses to effectively target and neutralize threats.

        <h4>1. Hematopoietic Stem Cell</h4>
        <p>
          At the very top of this process is the
          <strong>hematopoietic stem cell</strong>, a pluripotent cell that can give rise to many different types of blood cells.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Two Main Lineages</h4>
        <p>
          From the hematopoietic stem cell, two primary branches emerge:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Myeloid stem cell:</strong> Leads to red blood cells, platelets, and several types of immune cells.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lymphoid stem cell:</strong> Gives rise to cells involved in adaptive immunity, including T cells, B cells, and
            natural killer cells.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>3. Myeloid Lineage</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Megakaryoblast → Megakaryocyte → Platelets:</strong> Large cells that release tiny fragments called platelets,
            crucial for blood clotting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proerythroblast → Reticulocyte → Erythrocyte (Red Blood Cell):</strong> Cells that transport oxygen throughout
            your body.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Myeloblast → Granulocytes (Basophils, Neutrophils, Eosinophils):</strong> Cells that contribute to rapid responses
            against pathogens.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Monoblast → Monocyte → Macrophage:</strong> Cells that patrol the bloodstream and tissues, engulfing and digesting
            pathogens and debris.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>4. Lymphoid Lineage</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Lymphoblast → Natural Killer (NK) Cell:</strong> Cells of the innate immune system that target virus-infected
            and tumor cells.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lymphoblast → Small Lymphocyte → T Lymphocyte or B Lymphocyte:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>T lymphocytes (T cells):</strong> Coordinate immune responses or directly attack infected cells.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>B lymphocytes (B cells):</strong> Produce antibodies and can mature into plasma cells that secrete large
                quantities of these vital proteins.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="diagram-placeholder">Immune Cell Functions: Recognize → React → Regulate → Remember</div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Recognize:</strong> Cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, T cells, and B cells identify pathogens using
            specialized receptors—like pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), T-cell receptors (TCRs), and B-cell receptors
            (BCRs)—that bind to unique molecular patterns on invaders.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>React:</strong> Effector cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, and cytotoxic T cells, respond rapidly by
            initiating inflammation, phagocytosing pathogens, and releasing toxic mediators to eliminate the threat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Regulate:</strong> Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and other modulatory mechanisms maintain balance in the immune
            response. They secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines and other signals to prevent excessive damage to healthy tissues.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Remember:</strong> After an encounter with a pathogen, memory T cells and B cells are generated. These long-lived
            cells enable the immune system to mount a faster and more potent response upon re-exposure.

        </ul>
        <div class="note">
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Vaccines harness the immune system’s memory by introducing a similar, less harmful version of
            a pathogen. This controlled exposure generates memory T and B cells that ensure a faster, more potent response
            when encountering the actual pathogen or its mutations.

      <h2>Immune Response: Bootcamp and Battleground</h2>
      <p>
        Here is how your immune system fights against pathogens from the rapid, nonspecific detection by innate cells, to the precise,
        adaptive counterattack, and finally the formation of memory cells and safeguards against autoimmunity.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Detection and Immediate Response by the Innate Immune System</h3>
          <p>
            As soon as a pathogen enters the body, innate immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural
            killer cells spring into action. They recognize common molecular signatures, called pathogen-associated molecular
            patterns (PAMPs), using pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). This triggers rapid phagocytosis of invaders and
            the release of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukins and tumor necrosis factor) to recruit additional immune
            cells. The complement system is also activated, both to directly attack pathogens and to help bridge the innate
            and adaptive responses.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Signaling to Activate the Adaptive Immune System</h3>
          <p>
            When the initial innate response cannot fully contain the infection, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells
            take over. They capture fragments of the pathogen and display these antigens on their surface using major histocompatibility
            complex (MHC) molecules—the “tray” that presents the pathogen’s identity. This critical signal is relayed to
            T lymphocytes in lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissues, effectively summoning the specialized forces of the
            adaptive immune system.
          </p>
        </li>
        <div class="note">
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Cancer detection often relies on measuring biomarkers like CA 125 antigen in blood or urine, where
            elevated levels can indicate the presence of cancer.
          </p>
        </div>
        <li>
          <h3>Targeted Response by the Adaptive Immune System</h3>
          <p>
            The adaptive immune system deploys two main strategies to eliminate the pathogen: humoral immunity led by B lymphocytes and
            cell-mediated immunity driven by T lymphocytes.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>B Lymphocytes (Humoral Immunity):</strong>
              <p>
                B cells originate and mature in the bone marrow. Initially, they express IgM and IgD antibodies. When they encounter their
                specific antigen and receive assistance from T helper cells, they undergo a process called class switching
                to produce other antibody types, including IgG, IgA, and IgE. Differentiating into plasma cells, B cells
                then secrete these antibodies, which neutralize pathogens, promote opsonization (making the pathogens more
                “tasty” for phagocytes), and activate the complement system.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>T Lymphocytes (Cell-Mediated Immunity):</strong>
              <p>
                T cells are produced in the bone marrow but mature in the thymus, where they are rigorously selected for proper antigen recognition.
                There are several types of T cells:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <em>T Helper Cells (CD4+):</em> Assist B cells in antibody production and help activate other immune cells.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>T Cytotoxic Cells (CD8+):</em> Directly destroy virus-infected cells, cancer cells, and other abnormal
                  cells.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>T Regulatory Cells:</em> Suppress overactive immune responses to prevent the immune system from attacking
                  the body’s own tissues.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <div class="note">
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Aging reduces thymus size and T cell production, weakening the immune response to new threats
            like COVID‑19, which contributed to higher mortality in older adults.</p>
        </div>
        <li>
          <h3>Aftermath – Memory Formation and Autoimmune Safeguards</h3>
          <p>
            After the pathogen is cleared, the adaptive immune system consolidates its victory by forming memory B and T cells. These
            memory cells enable a quicker and stronger response if the same pathogen invades again. Additionally, the immune
            system implements safety checks—such as negative selection in the thymus and the regulation by T regulatory cells—to
            ensure that self-reactive lymphocytes are eliminated or kept in check, thereby preventing autoimmune diseases.
