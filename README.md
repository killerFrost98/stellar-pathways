# StellarPathways

## Enchancements
- [ ] Refactor classes properly
- [ ] Fix mars rocket not reaching mars. Add correction function for rocket
- [ ] Add static satellites at lagrange poitns. Shouldnt destabilize.

- [ ] Low earth orbit satellite revolving earth.
- [ ] Add pages where you show history of person and/or fields from start to end.
- [ ] Add pages where you show how we ended up with current theorem/state. Like how we measured speed of ligh. How we found distances between galaxies. How electro magnetism was invented. How all 4 forces combine to single force.
- [ ] Add pages for unsolved mystries. Like dark matter/enery, information paradox, etc.
